            <h3>Difference between Local Storage and session storage</h3>
            <b>Local Storage:</b>
            <p>
              localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even
              if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and
              reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
            </p>
            <b>Session Storage:</b>
            <p>
              sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page
              session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open.
              Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a
              new session and new storage.

            <h3>JavaScript Variable Scope</h3>
            <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java</p>
            <p>Scope refers to the availability of variables and functions in certain parts of the code.

                In JavaScript, a variable has two types of scope:
                
                1.Global Scope
                2.Local Scope</p>

                <p><b>Global Scope</b>
                    A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered a global scope variable.
                    
                    Let's see an example of a global scope variable.
                    
                   <pre> // program to print a text 
                    let a = "hello";
                    
                    function greet () {
                        console.log(a);
                    }
                    
                    greet(); // hello</pre>
                    Run Code
                    In the above program, variable a is declared at the top of a program and is a global variable. It means the variable a can be used anywhere in the program.
                    
                    The value of a global variable can be changed inside a function. For example,
                    
                    <pre>// program to show the change in global variable
                        let a = "hello";
                        
                        function greet() {
                            a = 3;
                        }
                        
                        // before the function call
                        console.log(a);
                        
                        //after the function call
                        greet();
                        console.log(a); // 3</pre>
                    Run Code
                    In the above program, variable a is a global variable. The value of a is hello. Then the variable a is accessed inside a function and the value changes to 3.
                    
                    Hence, the value of a changes after changing it inside the function.
                    
                   <b> Note:</b> It is a good practice to avoid using global variables because the value of a global variable can change in different areas in the program. It can introduce unknown results in the program.
                    
                    In JavaScript, a variable can also be used without declaring it. If a variable is used without declaring it, that variable automatically becomes a global variable.
                    
                    For example,
                    
                    <pre>function greet() {
                        a = "hello"
                    }
                    
                    greet();
                    
                    console.log(a); // hello</pre>
                    Run Code
                    In the above program, variable a is a global variable.
                    
                    If the variable was declared using let a = "hello", the program would throw an error.
                    
                    Note: In JavaScript, there is "strict mode"; in which a variable cannot be used without declaring it. To learn more about strict, visit JavaScript Strict.</p>

                    <h3>Local Scope</h3>
                    <p>
                        A variable can also have a local scope, i.e it can only be accessed within a function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Example 1:</b> Local Scope Variable
<pre>// program showing local scope of a variable
    let a = "hello";
    
    function greet() {
        let b = "World"
        console.log(a + b);
    }
    
    greet();
    console.log(a + b); // error
    Run Code
  <b>  Output</b>
    </pre>
helloWorld
Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined
In the above program, variable a is a global variable and variable b is a local variable. The variable b can be accessed only inside the function greet. Hence, when we try to access variable b outside of the function, an error occurs.


                    </p>
                    <b>let is Block Scoped</b>
The let keyword is block-scoped (variable can be accessed only in the immediate block).
<br>
<b>Example 2: block-scoped Variable</b>
<pre>// program showing block-scoped concept
    // global variable
    let a = 'Hello';
    
    function greet() {
    
        // local variable
        let b = 'World';
    
        console.log(a + ' ' + b);
    
        if (b == 'World') {
    
            // block-scoped variable
            let c = 'hello';
    
            console.log(a + ' ' + b + ' ' + c);
        }
    
        // variable c cannot be accessed here
        console.log(a + ' ' + b + ' ' + c);
    }
    
    greet();</pre>
Run Code
<b>Output</b>

Hello World
Hello World hello
Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined
In the above program, variable

a is a global variable. It can be accessed anywhere in the program.
b is a local variable. It can be accessed only inside the function greet.
c is a block-scoped variable. It can be accessed only inside the if statement block.
Hence, in the above program, the first two console.log() work without any issue.

However, we are trying to access the block-scoped variable c outside of the block in the third console.log(). This will throw an error.
